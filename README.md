## Thanks for using my gun system! It is (hopefully) (going to be) somewhat-similar to ACS.
The system is built using Rojo, so be sure to check it out. 

CURRENT VERSION: V[N/A] (indev)

## INSTALLATION GUIDE:
# ROJO:
1. Download code as a ZIP file.
2. Extract the archive into any folder.
3. Drag and drop EVERYTHING from the extracted folder into your project folder. Rojo should already be detecting that it is installed.

# DEFAULT STUDIO
1. Download code as a ZIP file.
2. -- Uhh, actually, there isn't a way to quickly install the system without using rojo, sorry for the inconvenience.
